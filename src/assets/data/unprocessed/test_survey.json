    "background": "\"Fog of Graves joins Bastion\\r\\nBorn under an ill omen, and (cruelly) named thus, \"\"The Fog That Rolls Out From The Graveyard\"\" or Fog of Graves (Fog to his friends) was abandoned to a temple shortly after his birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFog grew up tending to the temple, digging graves, learning mundane healing alongside healing with the red-white art, as well as rudimentary techniques of the red art. Many of his techniques come in the form of prayers and stories. All this alongside the combat training necessary to survive in the age of demiurges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple has long since been destroyed in war. Fog is now a wandering healer, Rayuba is his latest destination\\r\\n\\r\\nFog is not a powerful user of the Art, focusing more on speed, most of his techniques are things like dirt to Rock and healing wounds, though if given time to prepare he has rituals that he can use to pull off more dramatic feats.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis fighting style is usually quite grounded and defensive, maintaining distance using Amaryllis, obstructing his opponents path to him with the Red Art, he then uses trips, grapples, and hooking manoeuvrers to try to bring down and subdue his opponent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is not above using tooth and claw, and is very quiet, agile, and perceptive. His opponents should not rely on his cautious nature to give them time to plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis personality is quiet and thoughtful, but he has many tales to tell if given the chance, not many of them would improve the mood. This all makes him come across as grumpy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also carries a canvas bag of stuff; rations, medicines, bandages.\\r\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/102Qqzj\"",
